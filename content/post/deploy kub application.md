## Intro

After have created a Kubernetes cluster in my homelab with `kubeadm` in [that post]({{< ref "post/8-create-manual-kubernetes-cluster-kubeadm" >}}), my next goal is to expose a simple pod externally, reachable with an URL and secured with a TLS certificate verified by Let's Encrypt.

To achieve that, I will need several components:
- Service: TODO add oneline description
- Ingress: TODO add oneline description
- Ingress Controller: TODO add oneline description
- TLS Certificates: TODO add oneline description
