## Intro

In my homelab, I like to play around with tools like Ansible and Terraform. But the principal way to interact with those tools is the CLI. I love the CLI, but sometime a fancy web interface is great.

After having setup my OPNsense cluster, I wanted a way to keep it up to date. Of course I wanted it to be automated, so I thought about creating an Ansible playbook.
