## Intro

In my homelab, I like to play around with tools like Ansible and Terraform. But the principal way to interact with those tools is the CLI. I love the CLI, but sometime a fancy web interface is great.

After having setup my OPNsense cluster, I wanted a way to keep it up to date. Of course I wanted it to be automated, so I thought about creating an Ansible playbook. But how to automate and schedule an Ansible playbook?

In my work environment, I'm using the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform, which is great, but not suitable in my lab environment. That's how I found Semaphore UI. Let's see what this can do!
