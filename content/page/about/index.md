Hi! I'm Etienne, an **automation** lover and **homelab** projects enthusiast. I am a Linux SME and work as a **Senior Cloud DevOps Engineer** at Capgemini.

Driven by passion, I enjoy exploring new technologies, understanding how they work and experiment those at home, just for the joy of it. My lab has grown from a simple tinkering space into a full playground for experimenting with virtualization, container orchestration, networking, and much more.

This blog is my way of documenting what I build, break (on purpose!), fix, and above all, **learn**. Itâ€™s a personal reference, but also a way to give back to the community, I open source myself, in case someone else is on a similar path and finds value in my experience.

Even though I'm French, I write my personal notes in English to perfect my use of this language, but I still try to translate them into my mother tongue.

If you're working on something cool, have questions, or want to bring new ideas on the table, **feel free to reach out**!
