Hi! I'm Etienne, an **automation** lover and **homelab** enthusiast. I work as a **Senior Cloud DevOps Engineer** at Capgemini.

Driven by passion, I enjoy understanding how things work, exploring new technologies and experiment those at home, just for the joy of it. My homelab has grown from a simple tinkering space into a full playground for experimenting with virtualization, container orchestration, networking, and more.

This blog is my way of documenting what I build, fix, break (on purpose!), and above all, **learn**. It’s a personal reference, but also a way to give back to the community, in case someone else is on a similar path and finds value in my experience.

Even though I'm French, I write my personal notes in English to perfect my use of this language. But for my fellow countryman, I make the effort to translate them, which takes me a little more time.

If you're working on something cool, have questions, or want to bring new ideas on the table, **feel free to reach out**! I’d love to hear from you.
