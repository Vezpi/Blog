Hi! I'm Etienne, an automation lover and homelab enthusiast. I work as a Senior Cloud DevOps Engineer at Capgemini.

Driven by passion, I enjoy understanding how things work, exploring new technologies and experiment these at home, just for the joy of it. My homelab has grown from a simple tinkering space into a full playground for experimenting with virtualization, container orchestration, networking, and more.

This blog is my way of documenting what I build, fix, break (on purpose!), and above all, learn. It’s a personal reference, but also a way to give back to the community, in case someone else is on a similar path and finds value in my experience.

If you're working on something cool, have questions, or want to bring new ideas on the table, feel free to reach out! I’d love to hear from you.
